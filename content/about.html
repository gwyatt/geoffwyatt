# Hello

My name is Geoff Wyatt. I'm a big fan of technology, design, finance, and marketing. Currently I'm living in Toronto, Ontario.

This site is my little home on the internet. I'm interested in a ton of different things, and this blog will serve as way for me to voice and archive my ideas.
