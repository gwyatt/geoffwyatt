#Hello!

This site is now fully generated using [Hyde](http://hyde.github.com/)! I'm sure there are a number of places I can make improvements, and I'll continue to tinker with the layout over the coming days.  This is all possible due to the great resources out on the web; I'll be doing a full write-up on how I got the site set up in the coming days.
