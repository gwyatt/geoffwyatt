# Get Running With Hyde

As a bit of a pet project, I decided late last year to start up a blog. I 
planned to capture my rambling in a written form, as at any given time I have a
number of ideas floating around and felt it would be good to document them.

Of course being the person I am, I felt I could use this as an opportunity to 
learn something new.  With that in mind I decided to put together my own 
platform, and ended up deciding on [Hyde](http://Hyde.github.com/ "Hyde"). 

## Why Hyde?

The first decision was decide on a platform.  I had been in the process of
learning [Python](http://www.python.org/) for about a month, and was looking 
for something that was written in the language. I also knew there were (and 
still are!) limits to what I knew, so something simple to manage would be best.

After a bunch of research, I settled on [Hyde](http://Hyde.github.com/ "Hyde").
 Hyde is a static site generator. Essentially it allows you to define templates
, and generate static, flat, html files based on them. Utilizing [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/ "Markdown")
, you can write content in plain-text, and Hyde will generate a full site based
on your defined templates.

## First Steps

The first thing I did was grab the [Hyde source.](http://Hyde.github.com/ "Hyde
") The easiest way to do this is using [pip](http://pypi.python.org/pypi/pip 
"Pip"). Once pip is installed, it is as easy as running `pip install Hyde` from
within your terminal. This will install Hyde, along with all of its
dependencies if you have not installed them already.

From here, I created a new folder for my site and set up a default site. To do 
this I simply ran `Hyde create -l starter` to set up a default site based on 
[Merlin Rebrovic's Starter Kit](http://merlin.rebrovic.net/Hyde-starter-kit/about.html). 
This gave me a good skeleton to begin the development of my own site.

## Developing Templates

Templates for Hyde  are created using the [Jinja2](http://jinja.pocoo.org/docs/) templating language, which is heavily influenced
by the Django templating language.  The Jinja2 website has some excellent
 documentation, and I made great use of it when putting together this site.
 
Using the starting point provided by my skeleton, I began to hack away at my 
own site. The templates now are still very bloated, but seem to be working for 
the most part. There is a ton of room for improvement, and I'll be tweaking 
things as time progresses.

Jinja2 has some great and powerful features, one of which is macros. Macros can
easily be used to help automate the generation of your site. For example, the 
following code generates the listing of all blog posts I have written:

    {% raw %}
    {% for res in site.content.walk_resources_sorted_by_time() %}
        {% if res.meta.listable %}
            <tr>
                <td>
                <a href="{{ res.full_url }}">{{ res.meta.title|capitalize }}</a> 
                <span style="float:right">{{ res.meta.created.strftime('%d %b %Y') }}</span>
                </td>
            </tr>
        {% endif %}
    {% endfor %}
    {% endraw %}

There is great [Jinja2 template documentation](http://jinja.pocoo.org/docs/templates/#)
on the Jinja website. I'd urge you to take a read through and just play around 
with it. I learned a ton, and broke a ton, of stuff while trying to get this 
all running.

## All the Pretty Stuff

I am by no means a designer.  That is why I am using 
[Bootstrap](http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/ "Bootstrap")
 to handle the design of the site. Bootstrap is a simplified CSS framework designed
to help you get up and running quickly. I've made a few tweaks, but for the most
 part I am running it stock. Currently I am running v1.4. Version 2 was just
 released, and I'll be moving over to it shortly.
 
## Go Live!

Once I had everything set up and running all that was left was to deploy. For 
hosting I am using [Webfaction](http://www.webfaction.com "Webfaction"). So far
I have nothing but good things to say about their service. I didn't require a 
full-fledge VPS, however having shell access was a big thing for me.

I am using Apache as my web server. As of now it is configured in the most 
basic manner. I plan to get it rewriting links (hiding the ugly .html in the 
address bar) in the future.

## Resources

Now the most important bit. There is no way I could have done this without all
 of the great resources out there on the web. Some of the resources I made use 
 of were:
 
* [Hyde Source](https://github.com/Hyde/Hyde "Hyde Source")
* [Hyde Bootstrap](https://github.com/auzigog/Hyde-bootstrap "Hyde Bootstrap")
* [Hyde Powered Sites](https://github.com/Hyde/Hyde/wiki/Hyde-Powered "Hyde Powered")
* [Twitter Bootstrap](http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/ "Bootstrap")
* [Steve Losh](http://www.stevelosh.com "Steve Losh")

I'm sure I am missing a ton of information in this post, however I hope it gives
an idea of what is required to get a Hyde blog up and running. I'm still learning
how it all works, and you should see a number of changes as time goes on. If 
you want any more information on what went into this please contact me!
