# Python and Virtualenv

As I go further down my path of becoming a Python guru I continue to run into 
tools that make my life much easier. Once of these tools is [virtualenv](http://pypi.python.org/pypi/virtualenv). 

To sum it up, virtualenv is a simple way to create virtualized Python 
environments. One of the problems I found with Python was managing all of the 
packages I was making use of. Virtualenv gives me the ability to add a package 
to a specifc project, keeping my global Python environment nice and clean.

## Install and Configure

Installing virtualenv is a breeze. I'm going to assume that you have [pip](http://pypi.python.org/pypi/pip)
 up and running. To install virtualenv, open up a terminal session and run:

    sudo pip install virtualenv
    
That's it! Virtualenv is installed.
