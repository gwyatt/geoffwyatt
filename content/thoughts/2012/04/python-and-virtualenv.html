# Python and Virtualenv

As I go further down my path of becoming a Python guru I continue to run into 
tools that make my life much easier. Once of these tools is [virtualenv](http://pypi.python.org/pypi/virtualenv). 

To sum it up, virtualenv is a simple way to create virtualized Python 
environments. One of the problems I found with Python was managing all of the 
packages I was making use of. Virtualenv gives me the ability to add a package 
to a specific project, keeping my global Python environment nice and clean.

## Install and Configure

Installing virtualenv is a breeze. I'm going to assume that you have [pip](http://pypi.python.org/pypi/pip)
 up and running. To install virtualenv, open up a terminal session and run:

    sudo pip install virtualenv
    
That's it! Virtualenv is installed.

### Configure

To help keep myself organized, I decided to store all of my virtual environments within one folder. I opened up the terminal
 and created a folder in my home directly:

 	mkdir ~/virtualenvs

 Next up is to create a new virtual environment for your project. To do this open up your terminal and enter:

 	virtualenvs ~/virtualenvs/myproject

 This will create a directory 'myproject', and set up all the files needed to manage your virtual environment.

 To activate a virtual environment, simply type:

 	source ~/virtualenvs/myproject/bin/activate

 When your virtual environment is activated, all new python packages will be installed only to that project. To deactivate 
 an environment just type <code>deactivate</code> into the terminal.

I keep all of the projects I am working on in a single folder that matches with the name of my v

 That's it, easy and simple python package management.

## Bonus Points - Pip!

 For some extra fun, you can make good use of pip to help capture the packages you are making use of in your virtual environment. This is really helpful if you plan to deploy the same project elsewhere (think moving a local dev environment to a web server). With your virtual environment activated enter the following into your terminal:

 	pip freeze > requirements.txt

This will produce a text document with all the site packages your environment is using. When you decided to move to production, all you need to do is to transfer your requirements.txt file to the production server, and run the command:

	pip install -r requirements.txt

pip will then go ahead and download all of the packages your application requires. It's a super easy way to make sure you are installing the proper packages for your solution!
