# What We Can Learn From Kickstarter

Another win for Kickstarter. This morning [Ouya](http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/ouya/ouya-a-new-kind-of-video-game-console "Ouya") was listed on Kickstarter. Within 8 hours it had met its funding goal of $950,000. As of the time of this post (9:30 EST) they are currently sitting at $1,662,749 - 175% overfunded. Clearly the crowdfunding model is working.

One of the coolest things about Kickstarter is how it is changing the way new companies and people can do business. There are a ton of lessons to be learned, but I wanted to touch on three of the most important.

## Funding Model

Kickstarter is acting as an alternative funding model for tons of companies. Projects that were once incredibly hard to fund, such as consumer electronics products, are now able to obtain capital. Typically investors will avoid capital intensive products, as they require a much high rate of return, and they tend to take longer to pay out. 

By using Kickstarter, business are able to get around these constraints. Getting funding directly from consumers who want the product allows them to get up and running where they once may not have been able to.

## Validate Ideas

The crowdfunding model is also allowing businesses to validate their ideas with consumers. By getting an idea out there, and having consumers pledge money to it, startups are able to prove they have an idea worth building. This can be invaluable when first starting out. 

## Involved Consumers

One of the most interesting things about Kickstarter is the social nature of the platform. Kickstarter is helping prove that consumers are willing to take a risk and get involved in innovation. Kickstarter gives people the ability to invest in ideas and projects that they think are important. More importantly, they are talking about these projects with their friends.

Ouya is a perfect example of this. I woke up this morning and had no idea the project even existed. Before I hit work I checked a forum I frequent and noticed a post about the project. At lunch I saw some activity on my LinkedIn feed about the same project. By the time I got home they had exceeded their funding goal and were all over the news. It was interesting

## Changing Times

The Ouya project is obviously a small sample size. One project does not make a market. However you can cruise through an endless number of Kickstarter funded projects and notice a trend. You can even check a handy [stats page](http://www.kickstarter.com/help/stats "Kickstarter Stats") to see how much money has been funded through Kickstarter - $234MM as of this writing. 

More and more people are flocking to this model, and in the long term I really think it is going to help fuel innovative ideas that many investors might find too out-there for traditional funding models.
