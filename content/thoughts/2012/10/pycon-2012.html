# PyCon Canada

I am going to be heading down to [PyCon Canada](http://pycon.ca/ "PyCon Canada") this November. This my first developer conference, and I am pretty excited to meet some wickedly smart people at the event. As a marketing person, it will be good to attend a show from the other perspective - I'm usually the one doing the sponsoring or managing the booth!

I'll be attending mostly the newb friendly sessions, but really my goal is to get out and meet some people in the community. 

Should be a fun event!
