#I Have a Blog

I read a really interesting post on Hacker News a couple days ago, [Words](http://justinjackson.ca/words.html "Words"), and it reminded me that I have this dormant blog. While I don't agree that words alone are the be-all-end-all of the Internet, I do agree with the premise of the article. The Internet was meant for sharing awesome content with awesome people (or even terrible content with terrible people). We have been blessed to grow up in a world with this amazing technology, and I'll be the first to admit that I take it for granted.

I'm going to try to make it more of a point to share my thoughts, feelings, and ideas going forward. To start off I think I'll just take the easy way out and share a picture I took on a recent work retreat. I love the way it turned out so I figured I'd give it a home!
